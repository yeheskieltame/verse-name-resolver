# Username Resolution Fix - Debugging Guide

## Issue Identified ✅

The username resolution issue has been identified and fixed. The problem was that the system was trying to resolve usernames from Ethereum Mainnet where the SWNS contract is not yet deployed.

## Root Cause

1. **Hub Chain Configuration**: The system was configured to use Mainnet (Chain ID: 1) as the Hub Chain
2. **Contract Not Deployed**: The SWNS contract on Mainnet has address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (not deployed)
3. **Connection Mismatch**: The system was connecting to Mainnet but trying to query a non-existent contract

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. **Smart Fallback System**
- Added automatic fallback to Sepolia testnet when Mainnet contract is not available
- The system now properly switches both the RPC connection AND the contract address
- Console logging shows which chain is being used for resolution

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better error messages that explain where usernames are resolved from
- Added connection test functionality
- More detailed console logging for debugging

### 3. **UI Improvements**
- Added "Test Connection" button to verify Hub Chain connectivity
- Better error messages that mention Sepolia testnet
- Helpful tips for users on how to test the system

## Current System State

### Hub Chain Resolution
- **Primary**: Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1) - when contract is deployed
- **Fallback**: Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11155111) - currently active
- **Contract**: `0x6716724D0C2cD0F60A1455e96f5Edb66C2d3124E` on Sepolia

### Transaction Chains (Spoke Chains)
All EVM chains are supported for transactions:
- Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, BSC, Avalanche, Fantom, etc.
- Taranium, Sepolia, Holesky (testnets)

## How to Test Username Resolution

### Step 1: Register a Name (Required)
1. **Connect to Sepolia testnet** in your wallet
2. **Navigate to the Name Registration section**
3. **Register a test name** (e.g., "alice", "bob", "test123")
4. **Wait for transaction confirmation**

### Step 2: Test Cross-Chain Resolution
1. **Switch to any other chain** (e.g., Taranium, Polygon, Base)
2. **Go to the Token Transfer section**
3. **Click "Test Connection"** to verify Hub Chain connectivity
4. **Enter your registered name** (e.g., "alice.sw")
5. **Click "Resolve"** - should show the wallet address

### Step 3: Verify Logs
Open browser console to see detailed logs:
```
✅ CrossChainNameService initialized:
   - Hub Chain ID: 11155111
   - Contract Address: 0x6716724D0C2cD0F60A1455e96f5Edb66C2d3124E

🔍 Resolving name "alice" from Hub Chain (ID: 11155111)...
   - Contract Address: 0x6716724D0C2cD0F60A1455e96f5Edb66C2d3124E
✅ Name "alice" resolved to 0x123... from Hub Chain
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Name not found"
**Solution**: Make sure the name is registered on Sepolia testnet first

### Issue: "Connection Test Failed"
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify Sepolia RPC is accessible
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: "Network connection failed"
**Solution**:
- The default RPC might be down
- Try switching to a different network and back
- Check if Sepolia testnet is added to your wallet

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Connect to Sepolia testnet
- [ ] Register a test name (costs small amount of ETH)
- [ ] Switch to different chain (Taranium, Polygon, etc.)
- [ ] Test connection button shows success
- [ ] Enter registered name in transfer form
- [ ] Click resolve - should show wallet address
- [ ] Console shows detailed resolution logs

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Names**: Register actual names on Sepolia for testing
2. **Mainnet Deployment**: Deploy SWNS contract to Mainnet when ready
3. **Production Switch**: Update Hub Chain back to Mainnet once contract is deployed
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check resolution speed and reliability

The username resolution system should now work correctly across all chains, resolving names from Sepolia testnet while allowing transfers on any supported EVM chain.
