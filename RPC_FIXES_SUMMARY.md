# RPC Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RPC Free Tier Limitation
**Problem**: The free tier RPC was rejecting requests to get all events from "earliest" to "latest" blocks because it spans over 10,000 blocks.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented progressive block range queries starting with smaller ranges
- Query events in batches: 1000 → 5000 → 10000 blocks
- Stop querying once events are found to conserve RPC quota
- Graceful fallback to empty results if all ranges fail

### 2. Demo Name Resolution Errors
**Problem**: Demo names (alice, bob, charlie, etc.) were causing "ERC721NonexistentToken" errors because they don't exist in the actual contract.

**Solution**:
- Removed automatic resolution attempts for demo names
- Fixed the fallback logic to return empty arrays instead of trying to resolve non-existent names
- Made demo directory purely UI-based with static example data

### 3. Improved Error Handling
**Problem**: Users were seeing error toasts for expected empty contract states.

**Solution**:
- Removed error toasts for empty results (expected for new contracts)
- Added better console logging to differentiate between actual errors and expected empty states
- Improved UI messages to guide users on what to do next

## Code Changes

### `src/services/crossChainNameService.ts`
- `getAllRegisteredNames()`: Implemented progressive block range queries
- Removed the alternative name resolution fallback that was causing token errors
- Added better error handling and logging

### `src/components/CrossChainNameDirectory.tsx`  
- Removed error toast for empty results
- Added better console logging for debugging
- Improved empty state messaging

### `src/components/DemoNameDirectory.tsx`
- Enhanced demo mode explanation
- Added clearer indicators that these are examples, not real resolved names
- Improved UI to show how the system works

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed**: RPC free tier limitation issues
✅ **Fixed**: Demo name resolution errors  
✅ **Fixed**: Inappropriate error messages for empty contracts
✅ **Improved**: User experience with better guidance and messaging
✅ **Improved**: Error handling and logging for debugging

## Expected Behavior
- App loads without RPC errors
- Demo directory shows example names with clear labeling
- Cross-chain directory shows "No registered names found" with helpful guidance
- Console logs show progressive block range queries
- No more "ERC721NonexistentToken" errors

## Next Steps
1. Test name registration on Sepolia testnet
2. Verify that registered names appear in the Cross-Chain Directory
3. Test cross-chain sending functionality
4. Consider upgrading to premium RPC for full event history if needed for production
